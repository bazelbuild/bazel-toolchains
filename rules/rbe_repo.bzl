"""Repository Rules to pick/generate toolchain configs for a container image.

The toolchain configs (+ platform) produced/selected by this rule can be used
to, e.g., run a remote build in which remote actions will run inside a
container image.

Exposes the rbe_autoconfig macro that encapsulates all functionality to
create and use toolchain configs. The main use cases for this rule are
  1. If you use the rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image in your RBE builds: This macro
    enables automatic selection of toolchain configs for your RBE build.
    As long as you are using a release version of Bazel and have your pin
    to the bazel-toolchains repo up to date, this rule should "just work"
    to select toolchain configs that have been generated for you before hand.
    More details about the rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/google/rbe-ubuntu16-04

  2. If you use a container that extends from the rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image
    in your RBE builds: This macro allows you to define which version of
    the rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image you built yours from, and then it will either
    pick toolchain configs in the bazel-toolchains repo that work for you,
    or will generate them on the fly by pulling the rbe-ubuntu 16_04
    container you used as base and running some commands inside the container.
    The main reason for having to generate a toolchain config (as opposed to
    using one that is checked-in the bazel-toolchains repo) is due to your
    base rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image not being compatible with the latest one,
    for the given version of Bazel you are using.
    If you want to make sure you can use checked-in configs, you should
    rebuild your container, using the latest rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image as base,
    whenever you udpate Bazel versions.

  3. If you use a custom container that does not extend from the rbe-ubuntu 16_04
    image (or your project has custom configure like repo rules, or you
    need to run your configure like repo rules with different environment
    settings):

    3.1. If you don't mind having to generate configs each time you run Bazel from
      a clean client, then this rule can do just that, by simply specifying the
      relevant information about which container to use.

    3.2. If you don't want to generate configs every time, you can use
      rbe_autoconfig to setup a "toolchain_config_repo" from which anyone
      that builds on RBE with your container can pull pre-generated configs from.
      To do this, rbe_autoconfig allows specification of a 'toolchain_config_suite_spec'.
      A 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' specifies all details of an external repo
      that will be used to both export to and read from toolchain configs.
      Details for setting up a "toolchain_config_repo" are below.

    More about configure like repo rules: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution-rules.html#managing-configure-style-workspace-rules

If rbe_autoconfig needs to generate toolchain configs, the process is as follows:
- Pull the selected toolchain container image (using 'docker pull').
- Start up a container using the pulled image, copying either a small sample
  project or the current project (if output_base is set).
- Install the current version of Bazel (one currently running) on the container
  (or the one passed in with optional attr). Container must have tools required to install
  and run Bazel (i.e., a jdk, a C/C++ compiler, a python interpreter).
- Run a bazel command to build the local_config_cc remote repository inside the container.
- Extract local_config_cc produced files (inside the container) to the produced
  remote repository.
- Produce a default BUILD file with platform and toolchain targets to use the container
  in a remote build.
- Optionally copies the local_config_cc produced files to the project srcs under the
  given output_base directory.

For use case 1. If you use the rbe-ubuntu 16_04 image in your RBE builds,
add to your WORKSPACE file the following:

  load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive", "http_file")

  http_archive(
    name = "bazel_toolchains",
    urls = [
      "https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains/archive/<latest_release>.tar.gz",
      "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains/archive/<latest_release>.tar.gz",
    ],
    strip_prefix = "bazel-toolchains-<latest_commit>",
    sha256 = "<sha256>",
  )

  load(
    "@bazel_toolchains//repositories:repositories.bzl",
    bazel_toolchains_repositories = "repositories",
  )

  bazel_toolchains_repositories()

  load("@bazel_toolchains//rules:rbe_repo.bzl", "rbe_autoconfig")

  # This is the simplest form of calling rbe_autoconfig.
  # See below other examples, but your WORKSPACE should likely
  # only need one single rbe_autoconfig target
  rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_default",
    # If you want your rbe_autoconfig rule to never pull a container
    # and fail fast if toolchain configs are not available, uncomment the
    # following line:
    # use_checked_in_confs = "Force",
  )

For the recommended value of <latest_release> please see
https://releases.bazel.build/bazel-toolchains.html

For use case 2. If you use a container that extends from the rbe-ubuntu 16_04
image, add to your WORKSPACE file the following:

  <Add the bazel-toolchains repo http_archive, same as above>

  rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_default",
    base_container_digest = <SHA of rbe-ubuntu 16_04 you used as base>
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "your-project/your-image-name",
    # Digest is recommended for any use case other than testing.
    digest = "sha256:deadbeef",
  )

For use case 3.1. If you are using a custom container, and don't mind
having to generate configs each time, add to your WORKSPACE file
the following:

  <Add the bazel-toolchains repo http_archive, same as above>

  rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_your_custom_container",
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "your-project/your-image-name",
    # Digest is recommended for any use case other than testing.
    digest = "sha256:deadbeef",
  )


For use case 3.2. If you are using a custom container, and don't
want to generate configs every time. The setup is as follows:

Define a repo (can be the same where you host the sources you want
to build on RBE or a separate one) which will host your published
toolchain configs. We call this the "toolchain-config-repo" in the
below

Define a 'toolchain_config_suite_spec', which specifies a container
(repo + registry) and an output_base, the relative path, within
the toolchain-config-repo where toolchain configs will be published to.
You can only have one 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' per container for which
you will be producing toolchain configs for, but multiple versions of the same
container (i.e., with different sha / tags) can share the same
'toolchain_config_suite_spec'.
Also, the same 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' can also be used to host
multiple toolchain configs that vary in environment variables, and
additional config repos (i.e., repos corresponding to configure like
repository rules) that are needed for different types of builds. For example,
a configuration for msan (which needs specific env variables) and one for
default C++ builds can share an output_base.
Lastly, a 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' will store configs for several
versions of Bazel (any that you specify).

For detailed instructions of how to set up a 'toolchain_config_suite_spec'
please see //rules/rbe_repo/toolchain_config_suite_spec.bzl

Once you have set up the toolchain_config_suite_spec you can add to your
WORKSPACE the following:

  <Add the bazel-toolchains repo http_archive, same as above>

  load("//path/to_your/toolchain_config_suite_spec.bzl", "your_toolchain_config_suite_spec_struct")

  rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_your_custom_toolchain_config_suite_spec",
    export_configs = True,
    toolchain_config_suite_spec = your_toolchain_config_suite_spec_struct,
  )

You can then run:

RBE_AUTOCONF_ROOT=$(pwd) bazel build @rbe_your_custom_toolchain_config_suite_spec//...

This will create the toolchain configs in the 'output_base' defined in the
'toolchain_config_suite_spec'. It will generate configs for the current version
of Bazel you are running with (overridable via attr).
This will also (abusing Bazel hermeticity principles) modify the versions.bzl
file in the 'output_base'. This is so that subsequent executions of the target
(by you, or by any of your users after you have checked-in these generated files)
will be able to directly use them without having to generate them again.
You should check-in your repo these changes so that the generated configs
are available to all other users of your repo.

For users of your 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' all that they need to do is
add to their WORKSPACE:

  <Add the bazel-toolchains repo http_archive, same as above>

  load("//path/to_your/toolchain_config_suite_spec.bzl", "your_toolchain_config_suite_spec_struct")

  rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_your_custom_toolchain_config_suite_spec",
    toolchain_config_suite_spec = your_toolchain_config_suite_spec_struct,
  )

And that's it! They should be able to get checked-in configs every time,
as long as, whenever there is a new Bazel needed for RBE builds:
  - You, the owner of the 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' generates and
    publishes the new toolchain configs to your repo. This is needed because
    new Bazel versions can only be guaranteed to work with toolchain
    configs that were generated for the specific version of Bazel used.
  - The users of your 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' update their pin to
    your repo.

If you want to create (more) different sets of toolchain configurations (a toolchain_config_spec)
with a different set of env variables, you can do so by reusing the
'toolchain_config_suite_spec', and providing a distinct 'toolchain_config_spec_name'. Example:

rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_custom_env2",
    env = {<dict declaring env variables>},
    export_configs = True,
    toolchain_config_spec_name = "<unique name to assign this toolchain_config_spec>",
    toolchain_config_suite_spec = your_toolchain_config_suite_spec_struct,
)

rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_custom_env2",
    env = {<dict declaring env variables>},
    export_configs = True,
    toolchain_config_spec_name = "<unique name to assign this toolchain_config_spec>",
    toolchain_config_suite_spec = your_toolchain_config_suite_spec_struct,
)

As of Bazel 0.29.0, platforms support exec_properties instead of the deprecated
remote_execution_properties to configure remote execution properties. The new
field is a string->string dictionary rather than a proto serialized as a
string.

rbe_autoconfig now has a field use_legacy_platform_definition, which for
backward compatibility reasons is set by default to True. Setting it to False
causes the underlying platform to be configured using the new exec_properties
field.

Furthermore, rbe_autoconfig itself also has an exec_properties field. Any
values set there are used in configuring the underlying platform. This field
only works if use_legacy_platform_definition is set to False.

Note that the container image cannot be set in rbe_autoconfig via the
exec_properties field.

Here is an example of an rbe_autoconfig that configures its underlying platform
to set the size of the shared memory partition for the docker container to 128
megabytes.

load("@bazel_toolchains//rules/exec_properties:exec_properties.bzl", "create_rbe_exec_properties_dict")

rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_default",
    use_legacy_platform_definition = False,
    exec_properties = create_rbe_exec_properties_dict(docker_shm_size = "128m"),
)

Note the use of create_rbe_exec_properties_dict. This is a Bazel macro that
makes it convenient to create the dicts used in exec_properties. You should
always prefer to use it over composing the dict manually.

Additionally, there are standard execution property dicts that you may want to
use. These standard dicts should always be preferred if defined. These standard
dicts are defined in a local repo that can be set up via a Bazel macro called
rbe_exec_properties. The following example has rbe_autoconfig create an
underlying platform that allows network access to the remote execution worker.

load("@bazel_toolchains//rules/exec_properties:exec_properties.bzl", "rbe_exec_properties")

rbe_exec_properties(
    name = "exec_properties",
)

load("@exec_properties//:constants.bzl", "NETWORK_ON")

rbe_autoconfig(
    name = "rbe_default",
    use_legacy_platform_definition = False,
    exec_properties = NETWORK_ON,
)

For more information on create_rbe_exec_properties_dict, rbe_exec_properties
and other related Bazel macros, see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-toolchains/tree/master/rules/exec_properties

NOTES:

READ CAREFULLY THROUGH THESE NOTES, NO MATTER YOUR USE CASE:

NOTE 1: SETTING TOOLCHAIN FLAGS

This is not an up to date source for flags, and just provides general guidance
please see //bazelrc/.latest.bazelrc for the most up to date flags.

Once you have added the rbe_autoconfig rule to your WORKSPACE, you will
need to set up toolchain flags that select the appropriate toolchain configs.
The flags below, show an sample of those flags, which was last reviewed
with Bazel 0.25.0 and for a rbe_autoconfig rule with name 'rbe_default'.
If you are using a later version of Bazel or your rbe_autoconfig target
has a different name, please adjust accordingly.

      bazel build ... \
                --crosstool_top=@rbe_default//cc:toolchain \
                --host_javabase=@rbe_default//java:jdk \
                --javabase=@rbe_default//java:jdk \
                --host_java_toolchain=@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_hostjdk8 \
                --java_toolchain=@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_hostjdk8 \
                --extra_execution_platforms=@rbe_default//config:platform \
                --host_platform=@rbe_default//config:platform \
                --platforms=@rbe_default//config:platform \
                --extra_toolchains=@rbe_default//config:cc-toolchain \

NOTE 2: WHEN DOES THIS RULE PULL A CONTAINER

Most users of rbe_autoconfig do not expect their target to pull a container.
If your rbe_autoconfig rule nevertheless pulls a container its because it
could not find checked-in configs that match:
1- The Bazel version you are currently using
2- The container you selected (if you are not setting base_container_digest)
3- The environment or config repos you requested

The simplest fix for 1 is to update your pin to the bazel-toolchains repo (and
to the source of your custom 'toolchain_config_suite_spec'). If that does not
fix the issue, you can try to use an older toolchain cofig by passing
an older version in the bazel_version 'attr' (which may or may not work with
the current version you are running). You should also contact the owners of
bazel-toolchains (or the custom 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' repo) to have them
publish configs for any new version if they have not done so.

The simplest fix for 2, is to rebuild your custom container using as base
the latest version of the base_container_digest. If that does not work, contact
the owners of the bazel-toolchains repo (i.e., create an issue in this repo)
or the owners of custom 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' repo if you are using one.

The only possible fix for 3, if you want this custom config spec to be supported
with checked-in configs, is to contact the owners of the bazel-toolchains repo
(or the custom 'toolchain_config_suite_spec' repo), to ask them to add this spec
to their WORKSPACE and generate configs for it.

NOTE 3: USE OF PROJECT ROOT

When this rule needs to export toolchain configs, or when it needs
to generate configs for custom config repos (i.e., corresponding to
configure like repo rules needed in your RBE build), This rule depends
on the value of the environment variable "RBEAUTOCONF_ROOT".

This env var should be set to point to the absolute path root of your project.
Use the full absolute path to the project root (i.e., no '~', '../', or
other special chars).

NOTE 4: PREREQUISITES FOR RUNNING THIS RULE

If this rule needs to generate configs, it expects the following
utilities to be installed and available on the PATH:
  - docker
  - tar
  - bash utilities (e.g., cp, mv, rm, etc)
  - docker authentication to pull the desired container should be set up
    (rbe-ubuntu16-04 does not require any auth setup currently).

NOTE 5: HERMETICITY AND THIS RULE

Note this is a very not hermetic repository rule that can actually change the
contents of your project sources. While this is generally not recommended by
Bazel, its the only reasonable way to get a rule that can produce valid
toolchains / platforms that need to be made available to Bazel before execution
of any build actions, AND at the same time, make them available to other
users so they do not need to be regenerated again. This can be done, safely,
to a certain extent, because these containers are pulled and dealt with by
SHA, all the outputs produced should be completely independent of where they
were built and can be leveraged by all users of a container.

NOTE 6: KNOWN LIMITATIONS

  - This rule can only run on Linux or Windows if it needs to generate configs.
  - This rule uses Bazelisk to run Bazel inside the given container.
    The container, thus, must be able to execute the Bazelisk binary
    (i.e., Linux or Windows based container must be capable of running
    the respective linux-amd or windows-amd releases from
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases)
  - If using export_configs, and you have multiple rbe_autoconfig targets
    pointing to the same toolchain_config_suite_spec, these rules should not
    be executed together in the same bazel command, as they all depend on
    reading/writing to the same versions.bzl file.
  - This rule cannot generate configs if: 1) it needs to pull additional
    config repos and 2) the project's WORKSPACE contains local_repository
    rules pointing to directories above the project root.

    """ Creates a repository with toolchain configs generated for a container image.

    This macro wraps (and simplifies) invocation of _rbe_autoconfig rule.
    Use this macro in your WORKSPACE.

    Args:
      name: Name of the rbe_autoconfig repository target.
      base_container_digest: Optional. If the container to use for the RBE build
          extends from the container defined in the toolchain_config_suite_spec
          (by default, the rbe-ubuntu16-04 image), you can pass the digest
          (sha256 sum) of the base container using this attr.
          The rule will try to use of checked-in configs, if possible.
      bazel_version: The version of Bazel to use to generate toolchain configs.
          `Use only (major, minor, patch), e.g., '0.20.0'. Default is "local"
          which means the same version of Bazel that is currently running will
          be used. If local is a non release version, rbe_autoconfig will fallback
          to using the latest release version (see _BAZEL_VERSION_FALLBACK).
          Note, if configs are not found for a patch version, rule will attempt
          to find ones for the corresponding x.x.0 version. So if you are using
          Bazel 0.25.2, and configs are not found for that version, but are
          available for 0.25.0, those will be used instead. Note: this is only
          the case if use_checked_in_confs != "False" (string 'False').
      bazel_rc_version: The rc (for the given version of Bazel) to use.
          Must be published in https://releases.bazel.build. E.g. 2.
      toolchain_config_spec_name: Optional. String. Override default config
          defined in toolchain_config_suite_spec.
          If export_configs is True, this value is used to set the name of the
          toolchain config spec to be generated.
      config_repos: Optional. List of additional external repos corresponding to
          configure like repo rules that need to be produced in addition to
          local_config_cc.
      create_cc_configs: Optional. Specifies whether to generate C/C++ configs.
          Defauls to True.
      create_java_configs: Optional. Specifies whether to generate java configs.
          Defauls to True.
      create_testdata: Optional. Specifies whether to generate additional testing
          only outputs. Defauls to False.
      create_versions: Specifies whether to generate versions.bzl
          file in 'output_base' of the 'toolchain_config_suite_spec'.
          This option is temporary while migration to use.
          generated file by this rule is taking place.
          Defauls to True.
      digest: Optional. The digest of the image to pull.
          Should not be set if 'tag' is used.
          Must be set together with 'registry' and 'repository'.
      detect_java_home: Optional. Default False. Should only be set
          to True if 'create_java_configs' is also True. If set to True the rule
          will attempt to read the JAVA_HOME env var from the container.
          Note if java_home is not set and this is set to False, the rule will
          attempt to find a value of java_home in a compatible
          'toolchain_config_spec', fallback to using the 'default_java_home' in
          the 'toolchain_config_suite_spec', fallback to turning on 'detect_java_home,
          (unless use_checked_in_confs = Force was set), or otherwise fail with an
          informative error.
      env: dict. Optional. Additional environment variables that will be set when
          running the Bazel command to generate the toolchain configs.
          Set to values for marketplace.gcr.io/google/rbe-ubuntu16-04 container.
          Note: Do not pass a custom JAVA_HOME via env, use java_home attr instead.
      exec_compatible_with: Optional. List of constraints to add to the produced
          toolchain/platform targets (e.g., ["@bazel_tools//platforms:linux"] in the
          exec_compatible_with/constraint_values attrs, respectively.
      exec_properties: Optional. A string->string dict containing execution
          properties to be used when creating the underlying platform. When
          providing this attribute use_legacy_platform_definition must be set
          to False. Note that the container image property must not be specified
          via this attribute.
      export_configs: Optional, default False. Whether to copy generated configs
          (if they are generated) to the 'output_base' defined in
          'toolchain_config_suite_spec'. If set to False, a configs.tar file
          will also be produced in the external repo. This tar file can be then
          published to a URL and e.g., be used via an 'http_archive' rule
          from an arbitrary repo.
      java_home: Optional. The location of java_home in the container. For
          example , '/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64'. Should only be set
          if 'create_java_configs' is True. Cannot be set if detect_java_home
          is set to True.
          Note if detect_java_home is set to False and this is not set, the
          rule will attempt to find a value of java_home in a compatible
          'toolchain_config_spec', fallback to using the 'default_java_home' in
          the 'toolchain_config_suite_spec', fallback to turning on 'detect_java_home'
          (unless use_checked_in_confs = Force was set), or otherwise fail with an
          informative error.
      tag: Optional. The tag of the container to use.
          Should not be set if 'digest' is used.
          Must be set together with 'registry' and 'repository'.
          Note if you use any tag other than 'latest' (w/o specifiyng 'base_container_digest')
          configs will need to be generaed, and a container will need to be pulled.
          Note using 'latest' will default to the 'latest_container'
          defined in the 'toolchain_config_suite_spec'
      toolchain_config_suite_spec: Optional. Defaults to using @bazel_toolchains as
          source for toolchain_config_suite_spec.
          Should only be set differently if you are using a diferent repo
          as source for your toolchain configs.
          For details of the expected structure of toolchain_config_suite_spec dict please see
          //rules/rbe_repo:toolchain_config_suite_spec.bzl
      registry: Optional. The registry from which to pull the base image.
          Should only be set if a custom container is required.
          Must be set together with digest and repository.
      repository: Optional. he `repository` of images to pull from.
          Should only be set if a custom container is required.
          Must be set together with registry and digest.
      target_compatible_with: List of constraints to add to the produced
          toolchain target (e.g., ["@bazel_tools//platforms:linux"]) in the
          target_compatible_with attr.
      use_checked_in_confs: Default: "Try". Try to look for checked in configs
          before generating them. If set to "False" (string) the rule will
          allways attempt to generate the configs by pulling a toolchain
          container and running Bazel inside. If set to "Force" rule will error
          out if no checked-in configs were found.
      use_legacy_platform_definition: Defaults to True (for now).
          Specifies whether the underlying platform uses the
          remote_execution_properties property (if use_legacy_platform_definition
          is True) or the exec_properties property. The reason why this
          is important is because a platform that inherits from this
          platform and wishes to add execution properties must use the
          same field remote_execution_properties/exec_properties that
          the parent platform uses. This attribute must be set to False if the
          exec_properties attribute is set.
