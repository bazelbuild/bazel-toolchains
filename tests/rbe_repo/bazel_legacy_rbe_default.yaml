# Steps in this file use toolchain configs produced by rbe_default
# target with multiple versions of Bazel.
# Their purpose is to verify the checked in configs are usable on RBE
# with several older versions of Bazel

# Proper functioning of these test requires the _BAZEL_VERSION and
# _CONTAINER_MAJOR_VERSION substitution parameters to be set in the trigger
# with name "config: /bazel_tests_cloudbuild.yaml {_BAZEL_VERSION}"
# in https://pantheon.corp.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=asci-toolchain.
# _BAZEL_VERSION should point to a version of Bazel to verify with these tests
# _CONTAINER_MAJOR_VERSION must correspond to a valid container major version
# for which a toolchain config was published for the given bazel version.

steps:
# Test that runs with rbe_autoconfig with Bazel ${_BAZEL_VERSION}
# that verifies that @rbe_default works for Bazel 0.20.0 - 0.25.0
# These tests are separate from bazel_tests_cloudbuild.yaml as those
# tests depend on the bazelrc files numbered by versions.
# However, tests covered by this file have a bazelrc file that did
# not use @rbe_default.
# Starting with Bazel 0.26.0, @rbe_default is used in all bazelrc
# files, so bazel_tests_cloudbuild.yaml covers it.
