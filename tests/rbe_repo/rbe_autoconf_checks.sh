# This bash script defines common assertion functions for rbe_autoconfig
# file checks.
# Usage: Use only from an sh_test target.
# First argument is the location of the empty file in the test
# directory produced by rbe_autoconfig when create_testdata attr
# is used.
# All remaining args are interpreted as calls to functions in this
# file.
